## 🖥️ Installation Guide
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Install XAMPP or WAMP
To run this project, you need a local PHP server.  
Download and install **XAMPP** or **WAMP**:

- [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- [Download WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)

### 2️⃣ Setup the Database
1. Open **XAMPP/WAMP** and start **Apache & MySQL**.
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
3. Create a new database:  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE expense_tracker;
   ```
4. Import the SQL file provided in `database.sql` (found in the project directory).

### 3️⃣ Configure Database Connection
Edit the `database.php` file:
```php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "expense_tracker";

$connection = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $database);
if ($connection->connect_error) {
    die("Database connection failed: " . $connection->connect_error);
}
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Project
1. Place the project folder inside **`htdocs`** (if using XAMPP) or **`www`** (if using WAMP).
2. Open your browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://localhost/expense-tracker/
   ```
3. Register or log in to start tracking expenses.

## 📂 Folder Structure
```
/expense-tracker
│── database.sql          # Database schema
│── database.php          # Database connection
│── index.php             # Login Page
│── register.php          # User Registration
│── dashboard.php         # Main Expense Tracker Dashboard
│── profile.php           # User Profile Page
│── add_transaction.php   # Handles adding transactions
│── logout.php            # Ends user session
│── styles.css            # Custom styles
│── README.md             # Project Documentation
└── assets/               # Images, icons, etc.
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- If you get a **"Connection failed"** error, check that MySQL is running and your `database.php` credentials are correct.
- If transactions don’t show, make sure the database is imported correctly in `phpMyAdmin`.
